# Arpit Kumar - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
As a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering from C.V. Raman Global University, I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of technology and data.

I have consistently demonstrated my ability to excel, maintaining a CGPA of 8 while pursuing certifications in emerging technologies like Generative AI and Programming Fundamentals Using Python.

I’ve also worked on an exciting Car Price Prediction project, where I developed a machine learning model using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression techniques to predict car prices with 92.33% accuracy. This experience honed my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights using tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Excel.



This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics / Data Science related topics.

## Portfolio Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.

### Car-Price-Prediction
**Code:** (https://github.com/ar-pi-the/Car-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb)

**Goal:** To Predict the price of used cars using the various ML Models

**Description:** The Car Price Prediction project aims to estimate the price of a car based on various features such as make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant attributes. The model is built using Python and popular machine learning libraries, providing a robust solution for accurate predictions.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Achieved an exceptional 92.33% accuracy on the training dataset, demonstrating the robustness of the predictive model.

### Shark Tank India

**Goal:** The goal of the Shark Tank India Dashboard project is to create a visually engaging and interactive platform that provides comprehensive insights into the deals, investments, and entrepreneurial trends showcased on the show.

**Code:** [https://github.com/ar-pi-the/Shark-Tank-India-/blob/main/dashboard.pbix]

**Description:** This Power BI Dashboard is designed to provide an in-depth analysis of the deals, investments, and entrepreneurial trends featured on Shark Tank India. By transforming raw data into compelling visualizations, this dashboard offers a dynamic and interactive experience for exploring the show's investment landscape.

**Skills:** data cleaning, data modeling, hypothesis testing, data analysis expressions.

**Technology:** Python, Power Bi.

**Results:** The Shark Tank India Dashboard successfully transformed raw data into actionable insights, providing a comprehensive analysis of the show's entrepreneurial and investment ecosystem.



### Lead Project
**Code:** [https://github.com/ar-pi-the/LEAD-Project/blob/main/gitignore.txt]

**Description:** The purpose is to optimize the lead scoring mechanism based on their fit, demographics, behaviours, buying tendency etc. By implementing explicit & Implicit lead scoring modelling with lead point system.


**Skills:** Python

**Technology:** Matplotlib
